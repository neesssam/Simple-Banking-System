# Simple-Banking-System
This is a C++ program that simulates a simple banking system that allows users to transfer money between their savings and checking accounts. Here is a brief summary of how the program works:



1. The user is prompted to enter their checking and savings account balances.
2. If the user has more than $5,000 in their checking account, they are given a suggestion to transfer some money to their savings account to earn interest.
3. The user is asked if they would like to transfer money between their accounts.
4. If the user chooses to transfer money, they are asked which account they would like to transfer to/from (savings to checking or checking to savings).
5. The user is prompted to enter the amount they would like to transfer.
6. If the user does not have sufficient funds to complete the transfer, they are given a warning message.
7. If the transfer is successful, the program updates the account balances and displays the new balances.
